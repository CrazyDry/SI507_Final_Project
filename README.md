## Project Code
How to get API Keys:
* Get the OMDB API key here: https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx. Simply fill in the email address and submit to get your API key.
* Get the IMDb API key here: https://imdb-api.com/api. Register an account, and the key will appear in your profile.

How to Run the code:
* Replace the OMDB API key and IMDb API key with your keys in movie_search.py
* Simply run the Python 3 file final_proj.py, and enjoy the movie search by inputting your query and interactive option in the command-line tool

Required packages and software:
* Plotly
* Chrome Web Browser

## Data Structure

All my data is stored as tree structures in separate JSON files from the different data source.

Function load_cache() and save_cache() in python file load_save.py constructs trees from cached JSON files and stored data as JSON files.
* all_cache: JSON file contains brief data information stored in the tree structure.
* key_cache: JSON file contains search query and response results, stored in the tree structure
* omdb_cache: JSON file contains detailed data information stored in the tree structure. 
* IMDB Spoiler Dataset: JSON file contains plot summary and plot synopsis of movies, stored in the tree structure

## Interaction and Presentation Options

This project can help users search the movies based on some keywords. Detailed movie information will be generated and displayed in an HTML file.  Users can also visualize some stats related to these movies and compare for some interesting findings. Users can repeatedly search for new queries without restarting the program. All search records and related information will be cached for faster retrieval in future use.

To use this project, just simply run final_proj.py in python3. It will prompt and ask the user to type in the search query (keywords) for movies. It will search the result through the API and return a top 10 list of related movies. Users have options to check the detailed information for a single movie and view all movies at once. The program will automatically generate an HTML file containing this information and open it in the Chrome web browser (Only tested in MacOS). After viewing the web page, users can choose to check other movies if needed. It can also skip viewing the detailed information about the movie and go to the next step. Users now have the option to visualize related data generated by using Plotly and compare different movies. There are four visual options: run time comparison, box office comparison, IMDb rating comparison, and IMDb voting comparison. The program will automatically open visualization in a new webpage. This step can also be skipped if you donâ€™t want to visualize this data. In the end, the user can choose to start a new search on movies or quit the program. All cached files will be saved for future use.
